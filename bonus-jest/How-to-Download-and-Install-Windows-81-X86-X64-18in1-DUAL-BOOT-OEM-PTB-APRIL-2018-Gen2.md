You will need a torrent client software, such as uTorrent or BitTorrent, to download the file. The file size is about 6.4 GB, so make sure you have enough space on your hard drive and a stable internet connection.
 
## Step 2: Create a bootable USB drive or DVD
 
After downloading the ISO file, you need to create a bootable USB drive or DVD that you can use to install Windows 8.1 on your computer. You can use a free software, such as Rufus or WinToUSB, to create a bootable USB drive from the ISO file. Alternatively, you can use a free software, such as ImgBurn or CDBurnerXP, to burn the ISO file to a DVD.
 
You will need a USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage space or a blank DVD for this process. Make sure you backup any important data on your USB drive or DVD before proceeding, as they will be formatted during the process.
 
## Step 3: Partition your hard drive
 
Before installing Windows 8.1 on your computer, you need to partition your hard drive to create a separate space for the new operating system. You can use a free software, such as EaseUS Partition Master or MiniTool Partition Wizard, to partition your hard drive easily and safely.
 
You will need at least 20 GB of free space on your hard drive for Windows 8.1. You can create a new partition by shrinking an existing partition or deleting an unused partition. Make sure you label the new partition as "Windows 8.1" or something similar, so you can identify it later.
 
## Step 4: Install Windows 8.1
 
Now you are ready to install Windows 8.1 on your computer. You need to restart your computer and boot from the USB drive or DVD that you created in step 2. You can do this by changing the boot order in your BIOS settings or by pressing a key
